# dotfiles

This my project for various configuration files and setup scripts

## About my environment

I always have the directory `~/proj` in my home directory. Under that directory I have directories for all my projects, software and other. One subdirectory is `~/proj/github` where I have all my github projects. This dotfiles project is handled the same way.

I am using Vundle for handling vim plugins.

## Install

```
$ git clone https://github.com/pacoispaco/dotfiles.git ~/proj/guthub/dotfiles

$ git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
